              <p>
                JobAlign was founded in 2023 by a team of tech professionals who experienced firsthand the challenges of finding the right job match in a sea of opportunities. We realized that traditional job boards were inefficient, forcing job seekers to wade through hundreds of listings that often didn't match their skills or experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founders, who had backgrounds in artificial intelligence and recruiting, saw an opportunity to create a better way. By leveraging the power of AI, we could analyze both job seekers' skills and job requirements to create meaningful connections that benefit both parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a small experiment has grown into a platform that helps thousands of job seekers find their perfect career match every month. We're proud of the success stories we've helped create and are continuously improving our algorithms to make even better matches.

                At JobAlign, we believe that finding the right job shouldn't be a matter of luck or connections. It should be a data-driven process that respects the unique skills and potential of each individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our mission extends beyond just matching skills to job descriptions. We aim to understand the human behind the resume â€“ their career aspirations, work style preferences, and growth potential. This holistic approach allows us to make matches that lead to fulfilling, long-term career relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're also committed to creating a level playing field where bias is minimized. Our AI algorithms are designed to focus on skills and potential rather than factors that could lead to discrimination in the hiring process.
